# AI-Powered CLI Quiz App with RAG for Certification Preparation

Build an AI-powered Command Line Interface (CLI) quiz app that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create customized quiz questions from your own certification study notes. The example in this README uses the AWS AI Practitioner certification exam guide/notes, but you can customize the app for any certification or topic by simply swapping out the notes.

## Overview

- **Tech Stack**: Python, LangChain, AWS Bedrock, FAISS, DynamoDB
- **Key Components**:
  - **LangChain**: For managing AI model interactions and retrieval.
  - **AWS Bedrock**: Provides access to language models to generate quiz questions.
  - **FAISS**: Handles vector storage for fast and efficient information retrieval.
  - **DynamoDB**: Used to store quiz scores.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.10+
- **AWS Account**: For accessing AWS Bedrock and DynamoDB.
- **AWS CLI configured with credentials
- **Study Notes**: In PDF or Textformat, which can be loaded into the app.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv quiz_env
   source quiz_env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   quiz_env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up AWS credentials**:
   Configure AWS CLI with your credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

5. **Add your study notes**:
   Replace the sample file path in `load_documents` function with the path to your PDF file.

## Running the App

Once set up, run the following command to start the app:
```bash
python RAG_certs_cli.py
```

## Usage

1. The app will load your notes and generate quiz questions using RAG.
2. You’ll be able to answer questions in the CLI, and the app will provide feedback and explanations.
3. Scores are saved in DynamoDB so you can track your progress over time.

## Key Code Components

- **Loading Documents**: Uses `PyPDFLoader` from LangChain to load PDF notes.
- **Creating Vector Store**: Converts notes into embeddings and stores them using FAISS for efficient retrieval.
- **Generating Quiz Questions**: Uses AWS Bedrock and LangChain to create RAG-based quiz questions.
- **Storing Results**: Saves quiz scores to DynamoDB for tracking.

## Customization

- **Changing Notes**: Replace the PDF file with any study notes to customize the questions.
- **Adjusting the Model**: Modify the `generate_quiz_questions_with_rag` function to change the prompt or model settings as needed.

## Costs

This app incurs costs based on usage of AWS Bedrock and DynamoDB. Here’s an approximate breakdown:
- **AWS Bedrock**: Charges based on the number of model invocations and data processed.
- **DynamoDB**: Charges depend on read and write units. Cost can be minimized with a free tier or by adjusting the read/write capacity.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Modules**: If you see errors for missing modules, ensure all dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **AWS Access Issues**: Confirm your AWS credentials are configured correctly.
